      summary: Create a new payment link
      description: |-
        Create a new checkout link with Nexi. The link can then be used for
        paying the defined amount and can be presented to the user by redirection from
        our shop page.

        When creating a link, the adapter automatically configures
        webhooks to receive notifications from Nexi about payment events,
        such as when a payment is created or completed.

        We intentionally work with as little information as possible. Specifically,
        we avoid attaching and personally identifiable information.
        
        Note that links created by this adapter expire after 12-24 hours.
